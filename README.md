- **📱 Responsive Design** with Tailwind CSS and modern UI components
- **⚡ Real-time Console Logging** of authenticated API responses
- **🛡️ CSRF Protection** with state parameter validation
- **🍪 Secure Session Management** with HTTP-only cookies
- **📊 Track Statistics** including plays, likes, duration, and unique artists
- **🎨 Rich Track Cards** with artwork, metadata, and social stats
- **🔗 Direct SoundCloud Links** to tracks and artist profiles

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
- **npm** or **pnpm** package manager
- A **SoundCloud Developer Account**
- An **Upstash Account** for KV storage

### 1. SoundCloud App Setup

1. Go to [SoundCloud Developers](https://soundcloud.com/you/apps)
2. Create a new app or select an existing one
3. In your soundcloud app settings, set the **Redirect URI** to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/login/success
   ```
   Ask the soundcloud support for two apps, one with your production endpoint (https://myapp.com/redirect_uri) and one with a local endpoint (http://localhost:3000/redirect_uri). This way, you can use the respective id and secret id so that the redirect uri can be tested locally.
4. Note down your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 2. Upstash KV Setup

1. Create an account at [Upstash](https://upstash.com/)
2. Create a new **Redis database**
3. Go to your database details page
4. Copy the **REST URL** and **REST Token**

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```env
# SoundCloud OAuth Configuration
SOUNDCLOUD_CLIENT_ID=your_soundcloud_client_id_here
SOUNDCLOUD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_soundcloud_client_secret_here
SOUNDCLOUD_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/login/success

# Upstash KV Configuration
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your_upstash_redis_rest_url_here
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_upstash_redis_rest_token_here

# Next.js Configuration (optional)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret_key_here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the files)
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## 🔧 How to Use

### Step 1: Access the App
- Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
- You'll see the main page with a "Sign in with SoundCloud" button

### Step 2: Authentication
1. Click the **"Sign in with SoundCloud"** button
2. You'll be redirected to SoundCloud's authorization page
3. **Log in** with your SoundCloud credentials
4. **Authorize** the app to access your basic profile information
5. You'll be redirected back to the success page

### Step 3: View Your Dashboard
- After successful authentication, you'll see a tabbed interface with:

**Profile Tab:**
  - **Comprehensive user information** with avatar, display name, and online status
  - **Detailed statistics** including followers, following, tracks, likes, reposts
  - **Account information** like plan type, upload quota, and email verification
  - **Privacy settings** showing private tracks and playlists  
  - **Bio, location, and website** information
  - **Subscription details** if applicable

**Liked Tracks Tab:**
  - **Paginated list** of your liked tracks with artwork
  - **Track details** including title, artist, duration, and genre
  - **Social statistics** showing plays, likes, and comments for each track
  - **Aggregate statistics** for total plays, likes, duration, and unique artists
  - **Direct links** to tracks and artists on SoundCloud

### Step 4: Console Logging
- Check your browser's **Developer Console** or the **terminal** where you're running the app
- You'll see the authenticated API response from SoundCloud's `/me` endpoint

### Step 5: Logout
- Click the **"Logout"** button to end your session
- You'll be redirected back to the main page

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Authentication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant App
    participant SoundCloud
    participant Upstash
    
    User->>App: Click "Sign in"
    App->>Upstash: Store PKCE data
    App->>SoundCloud: Redirect with auth URL
    SoundCloud->>User: Show authorization page
    User->>SoundCloud: Authorize app
    SoundCloud->>App: Redirect with auth code
    App->>SoundCloud: Exchange code for tokens
    SoundCloud->>App: Return access token
    App->>SoundCloud: Fetch user profile (/me)
    App->>Upstash: Store tokens & session
    App->>User: Show profile page
```

### Key Security Features

- **PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)**: Prevents authorization code interception attacks
- **State Parameter**: Protects against CSRF attacks
- **HTTP-only Cookies**: Secure session management
- **Token Encryption**: Tokens stored securely in Upstash KV
- **Automatic Refresh**: Tokens are automatically refreshed when expired

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Failed to initiate authentication"**
- Check your `SOUNDCLOUD_CLIENT_ID` in `.env.local`
- Verify the redirect URI in your SoundCloud app matches exactly

**2. "Invalid redirect URI"**
- Ensure your SoundCloud app's redirect URI is set to: `http://localhost:3000/login/success`
- Check that `SOUNDCLOUD_REDIRECT_URI` in `.env.local` matches

**3. "Token exchange failed"**
- Verify your `SOUNDCLOUD_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env.local`
- Check that your SoundCloud app is properly configured

**4. "Database connection failed"**
- Verify your Upstash `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`
- Ensure your Upstash database is active

**5. "User profile not loading"**
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify your access token is valid
- Ensure SoundCloud API is accessible

### Debug Mode

To enable debug logging, add to your `.env.local`:
```env
NODE_ENV=development
```

Then check the browser console and terminal for detailed logs.
